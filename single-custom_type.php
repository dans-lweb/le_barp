/*
 * CUSTOM POST TYPE TEMPLATE
 *
 * This is the custom post type post template. If you edit the post type name, you've got
 * to change the name of this template to reflect that name change.
 *
 * For Example, if your custom post type is "register_post_type( 'bookmarks')",
 * then your single template should be single-bookmarks.php
 *
 * Be aware that you should rename 'custom_cat' and 'custom_tag' to the appropiate custom
 * category and taxonomy slugs, or this template will not finish to load properly.
 *
 * For more info: http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Type_Templates
